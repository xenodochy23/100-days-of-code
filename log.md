# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 23,2022  
##### 

**Today's Progress**:  I started my 100 ü¶æ Days of Code with a Mini M.E.R.N project to create a Note App. I started coding and setting up the backend FIRST. I imported the technologies that I learned and what i will use on this project. First i imported and setup a server files and imported express.js, mongoose, cors and body-parser to communicate with frontend/client side and database(MongoDb) and I learned more about Mongoose and express.JS first and really dive in to every line of code and what it really does. 

-I also practiced to add more comments on every single line of code because that will be the way i expressed what i have learned and also whoever looks in to my code will understand the function or what the line does. üëåüèæ

**Thoughts:** 
I learned more about Database, HTTP Request and MongoDb, mongoose, express.Js and understood more about Middlewares. 
What is Middleware? It is those methods/functions/operations that are called BETWEEN processing the Request and sending the Response in your application method.

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

### Day 2: June 24,2022 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: With Continuation of my Note App Project. The backend is fully setup and established. Using Model View Controller approach. 
1.) Model folder build MongoDb Schema 
The database schema is a structure of a database described in a formal language supported by the database management system. The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed. 

2.) Configuration connection to connect from middleware to database using Mongoose 
https://mongoosejs.com/

3.) Controller and Routes for reponse and request from the client side.

**Thoughts:** 
It is really important to know how to organize your folders using MVC approach,  I can easily track down the errors.
Using more comments to know the code and what it does

### Day 3: June 25,2022 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Setting up React Frontend created a seperate Folder for client/frontend. But also i have to layout my design for my app so it take a while for me to get a decent design for a note app. 

**Thoughts:** 
I learned to setup react js learning documentations and learning more about Layout Design first so you can overview and easy to build your application. also by laying down a wireframe or prototype you already made a blueprint of the application.

### Day 4: June 26,2022 
##### 

**Today's Progress**:  I used also a component based ui framework for React for Faster development so i used ChakraUI. although many css frameworks that is popular. I love working with ChakraUI they have cool documentation and easy to understand and build applications 

**Thoughts:** 
I learned a lot and excited to build more apps with ChakraUI although i love to learn other CSS React Libraries. I love to work with documentation and with CSS its really easy to stay in one place building Components and CSS with Chakra UI

### Day 5: June 27,2022 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Build Components that i will use for note app. I build Navigation bar, Create , Delete, Edit and Home Components that will serve their own functions later. I used React Router to route and link navigation path url.

**Thoughts:** 
Learning about setting up about frontend. the beauty of React when

### Day 6: June 28,2022 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Used Postman to test my backend communication. I imported a dependency called Axios and it is a promise-based HTTP Client communicate with to call response and request from server side.

 Create and View Components successfully done. We can able to Read and Create Notes & The name of the creator.  View all your notes at home page. 

**Thoughts:** 
 Axios communicates with server to do HTTP Request. I Test first my request using POSTMAN since i got some errors in naming syntax with frontend and i was able to catch and fix it. As far as UI still in progress since i got to learn more of Chakra UI.
