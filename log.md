# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 23,2022  
##### 

**Today's Progress**:  I started my 100 ü¶æ Days of Code with a Mini M.E.R.N project to create a Note App. I started coding and setting up the backend FIRST. I imported the technologies that I learned and what i will use on this project. First i imported and setup a server files and imported express.js, mongoose, cors and body-parser to communicate with frontend/client side and database(MongoDb) and I learned more about Mongoose and express.JS first and really dive in to every line of code and what it really does. 

-I also practiced to add more comments on every single line of code because that will be the way i expressed what i have learned and also whoever looks in to my code will understand the function or what the line does. üëåüèæ

**Thoughts:** 
I learned more about Database, HTTP Request and MongoDb, mongoose, express.Js and understood more about Middlewares. 
What is Middleware? It is those methods/functions/operations that are called BETWEEN processing the Request and sending the Response in your application method.

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

### Day 2: June 24,2022 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: With Continuation of my Note App Project. The backend is fully setup and established. Using Model View Controller approach. 
1.) Model folder build MongoDb Schema 
The database schema is a structure of a database described in a formal language supported by the database management system. The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed. 

2.) Configuration connection to connect from middleware to database using Mongoose

3.) Controller and Routes for reponse and request from the client side.

**Thoughts:** 
It is really important to know how to organize your folders using MVC approach,  I can easily track down the errors.
Using more comments to know the code and what it does
